In the fast paced world of basketball, the performance of the players is often refined into quantifiable data, which then is scrutinized by teams and fans alike. 
This data is used to determine the skills and worth of a NBA player and team either to get players or learn more about the strenghts and weakensses of a team. 
This project takes a look at the player statistics from the 2022/2023 NBA regular season. We are focusing on the main three statistics: points, rebounds, and assists.

By looking at these statistics, this project aims to uncover some patterns and insights that can contribute to a deeper understanding of player performance and possibly even team success. 
Through the comprehensive data science pipeline of data collection, processing, exploratory analysis, and visualization, we look to provide that deeper understanding of player performance. 
Additionally this project uses modeling techniques to test some hypotheses and apply machine learning algorithms as well, aiming to predict points, assists, and rebounds of NBA players.
